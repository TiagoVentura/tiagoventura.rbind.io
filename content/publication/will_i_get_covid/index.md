abstract: In these polarized times, not even perceptions of personal risk are immune to partisan considerations. We report results of a COVID-19 social media framing experiment with positive and negative partisan messages from high-level politicians. Descriptive results show that pro-government and opposition partisans report very different expectations of health and job risks. Job and health policy have become wedge issues that elicit partisan responses. Experimental treatment shows that responses are sensitive to negative frames (i.e. blame avoidance) and positive frames (i.e. cross-the-aisle). Negative social media messages from a pro-bolsonaro politician reduces overall support for the government and increases perceptions of health and job risks. The experiment explains key cognitive mechanisms driving partisan differences in perceptions of health risks and job security during the COVID-19 pandemics.
