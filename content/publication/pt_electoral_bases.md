abstract = "This article analyzes the evolution of the Workers’ Party’s (PT) electoral bases in the disputes for the Chamber of Deputies between 1994 and 2014. Using descriptive analysis and longitudinal models, we find that these bases are changing toward smaller cities with a lower per capita income, located, primarily, in northeastern Brazil. We show that the PT’s electoral bases for the Chamber of Deputies and presidency have experienced similar changes. However, while Bolsa Família influences support for the party’s presidential candidates, it has no impact on support for its candidates in the Chamber. Instead, we find that the party’s presence in subnational executives and its voting in gubernatorial and presidential elections are more relevant indicators of its performance."
