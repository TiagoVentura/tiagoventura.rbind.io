abstract = "In federal democracies, political parties often invest in local politics to increase their gains nationally. This strategy is crucial in noisy democracies with fragmented party system and inattentive voters. I define this strategy as political boosting and investigate its dynamics for the Brazilian case, a textbook example of a noisy, fragmented democracy. I test the model analyzing all the elections between 2000 and 2014 in Brazil using a regression discontinuity design and a LASSO Bayesian estimator to manage data sparsity for the subgroup party effects. I show that when a political party elects mayors, it significantly boosts the party national performance for the following House elections. Party Coordination among different offices and levels explain most of the boosting effect vis-a-vis mayor's career ambition. Large party bias in political boosting are also detected. By disentangling the effects winning local in federal democracies, the paper explains the general logic by which parties build electoral strength in fragmented polities."
