My three-paper dissertation focuses on violence and preferences for harsh-on-crime policies in Latin America. My dissertation works around these three main questions: how citizens form preferences about security policies when stressed about risk of crime victimization? How exposure to crime affects citizens' willingness to invest in security? And how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies?  My work is theoretically driven, and I integrate these questions developing an insurance model to understand micro-level preferences for punitive security policies. 

My first paper develops a model to explain preferences for crime deterrence policies and uses survey experiments to assess the model's empirical implications; the second paper (job market paper) brings together fine-grained observational data, an endorsement experiment, and text-analysis on congressional speeches to understand the effect of crime victimization, income inequality and partisanship on voting for law and order candidates for legislative elections in Brazil. The third paper uses novel network models and a conjoint design to uncover the effects of exposure to criminal violence on citizens' voting preferences in Mexico.  

In my job market paper *Voting for Violence: Crime and The Election of Law and Order Politicians in Brazil*, I develop a theory to explain how concerns about crime affect voting behaviour on newly democratized and violent societies. I argue that as crime concerns increases security appeals from political candidates enter into the electoral arena as a wedge issue, in which voters have sharply divisive preferences about the best political strategies to reduce crime. Rather than valence, preferences for security policies align with prior partisan identities and income status as the salience of violence increases.  The paper uses a unique combination of computational text-analysis on thousands of congressional speeches, fine-grained observational data with causal models, and an online endorsement experiment to provide evidence of my theory. 

My most important result shows that crime shocks around the time of the elections increase substantively the vote share of law-and-order candidates for the Brazilian House. This electoral boost comes mostly from a greater alignment of conservative voters to law-and-order candidates, and within each city, greater support from voters living in wealthier neighborhoods. My endorsement experiment replicates the macro-level findings. The results converge with the macro-findings, and reveal partisan dynamics on how respondents react to messages about public security, and key behavioral dynamics related to punitive preferences and concerns about security. I use the text-analysis to discuss how and who talks about security policies in the Congress, highlight how elected law and order politicians control this issue in the Congress. 

A draft of my job market paper recently won the Mario Fuks Award for the Best Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of The Brazilian Political Science Association - Political Behaviour Section.
