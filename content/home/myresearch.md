My dissertation research focuses on criminal violence and political behavior in Latin America. The three papers I develop on my dissertation deals with issues as how citizens make strategic decisions about security policies in violent democracies, how exposure to crime affects citizens' willingness to invest in security, and how these concerns ultimately enter into the electoral arena via support for candidates campaigning on tough-on-crime policies.  

My first paper brings together fine-grained observational data, an endorsement experiment, and text-analysis on congressional speeches to understand the effect of crime victimization and partisanship on voting for law and order candidates for legislative elections in Brazil. 

The second paper develops a formal model to explain preferences for crime deterrence policies. The model is built upon previous work on redistributive politics and argues that behavioral reactions to risks of victimization are driven by both insurance and redistributive dynamics. I use survey experiments to assess the model's empirical implications. 

The third paper uses novel network models and a conjoint design to uncover the effects of exposure to criminal violence on citizens' voting preferences in Mexico. This paper is co-authored with Francisco Cant√∫ and Sandra Ley.

My dissertation combines causal inference models with observational data, computational text-analysis, and multiple experiments to understand preferences for punitive policies, the behavioral consequences of crime victimization in Latin America and its effects on the electoral arena.
