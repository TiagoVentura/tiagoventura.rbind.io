# About Me


Hi, welcome to my website!  I am a Ph.D. Student in Political Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I hold a PhD and Master degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, and a BA in Law at Federal University of Para, Brazil. My research agenda is broadly speaking focused on politics of wealth inequality and violence in Brazil. I am also deeply interested in computational social science, and the use of cutting-edge research strategies to help us understand social science puzzles. 


This summer I was invited to attend the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Princeton and the Summer Institute of the EITM in Emory. If you are around, and want grab a coffee, ideally a strong Brazilian expresso, just let me know!
