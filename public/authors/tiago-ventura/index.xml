      <description>We report results of a COVID-19 social media framing experiment with positive and negative partisan messages from high-level politicians. Descriptive results show that pro-government and opposition partisans report very different expectations of health and job risks. Job and health policy have become wedge issues that elicit partisan responses. Experimental treatment shows that responses are sensitive to negative frames (i.e. blame avoidance) and positive frames (i.e. cross-the-aisle)</description>

      <description>We investigate how streaming chatboxes may shape perceptions of political events. We conducted a field experiment during the September 2019 Democratic Primary Debate where subjects were assigned to view the debate with or without streaming chatboxes. Subjects were encouraged to view the debate on the ABC homepage (with no chatbox), on FiveThirtyEight.com (expert chat) or on Facebook (social chat). Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects assigned to the Facebook chat condition reported lower affect towards Democrats and a worse viewing experience.</description>

      <description>This article introduces the concept of adjudication to define the act of granting or denying ownership of an outcome to individuals or groups in social media. We extend existing models of political dialogue to explain differences between winners and losers when elections are adjudicated.</description>

      <title>Going Local to Win the Nation: Political Boosting in Mayoral Politics.</title>

      <description>In this paper, I show that parties in Brazil boost their national performance earning more votes on House elections in districts where their members control the local office.  I discuss how higher access to pork controlled by House members and information gains from local incumbency explain the effects. Using a Bayesian LASSO algorithm to address data sparsity in RD designs, I further show the existence of pro-large party bias.</description>
