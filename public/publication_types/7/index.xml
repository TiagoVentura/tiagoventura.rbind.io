      <description>In this paper, I show that parties in Brazil boost their national performance earning more votes on House elections in districts where their members control the local office.  I discuss how higher access to pork controlled by House members and information gains from local incumbency explain the effects. Using a Bayesian LASSO algorithm to address data sparsity in RD designs, I further show the existence of pro-large party bias.</description>
